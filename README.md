# PP-Trine-Parser
This script parses the interests generated by the loans you invested in on the P2P platform Trine.
This data can then be used to be imported as CSV to [Portfolio Performance](https://www.portfolio-performance.info/). This project was inspired by https://github.com/ChrisRBe/PP-P2P-Parser.

Note that this project is not affiliated with Trine or Portfolio Performance.

## Preconditions
1. Make sure you have Python3 installed on your system. This project is designed to run on Linux.
1. Checkout the project
    `git clone https://github.com/StegSchreck/PP-Trine-Parser.git && cd PP-Trine-Parser`
1. Install the requirements with pip for Python3
    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the script
First, you'll have to download the transaction from [Trine's transactions page](https://trine.com/dashboard/transactions). This script does not login to Trine, as it wouldn't be able to handle MFA during the authentication process.

To start the parser run the following command:
```
python3 main.py --file <location of input file>
```

Upon completion, the script will print the name and location of the export file containing the data.
You can start the import to Portfolio Performance using this file then.

## Call arguments / parameters
### Mandatory
`-f` / `--file`: input file for the script - exported from Trine

### Optional
`-d` / `--destination`: destination folder for the resulting CSV file containing the parsed data

`-v` / `--verbose`: increase output verbosity

`-h` / `--help`: Display the help, including all possible parameter options
